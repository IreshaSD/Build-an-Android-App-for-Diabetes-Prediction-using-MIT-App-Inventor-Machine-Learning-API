# Build-an-Android-App-for-Diabetes-Prediction-using-MIT-App-Inventor-Machine-Learning-API

The project outlines the steps to build an Android application capable of predicting diabetes through a pre-trained Machine Learning model.

### Key Features:

1. Uses a free, public diabetes prediction API (hosted on Heroku)
2. Leverages MIT App Inventor, a drag-and-drop tool for building Android apps
3. Allows users to input eight data points (e.g., glucose level, blood pressure) for diabetes prediction
4. Provides results indicating potential diabetic risk
   
### Project Scope:

This repository focuses on developing the Android application using MIT App Inventor to interact with a pre-existing diabetes prediction API.

### Who Should Use This:

This project is ideal for beginners interested in:

1. Building Android apps with MIT App Inventor
2. Integrating Machine Learning APIs into mobile applications
3. Exploring basic concepts of diabetes prediction using machine learning
   
This project leverages a pre-trained diabetes prediction model as an API. The accuracy and limitations of the model are dependent on the source and training data used.
